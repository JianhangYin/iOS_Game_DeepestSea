# DeepestSea
This game is now available on apple store! Check more details on my personal website: www.jianhangyin.com

DeepestSea is my first pixel art game for iPhone and iPad. It is a SpirteKit game built in Swift 4.1. The graphics in the game are designed and made by myself with Photoshop. I was born in the 1990s, when the family computer (FC) was very popular in China. So I became a super fan of pixel art game. In this game, three different kinds of submarine can be selected by the player, they have different initial HP and weapon. The bomb system is also introduced into this game. During the game, you will meet several kinds of deep sea creatures. Letâ€™s explore the deep blue ocean!
